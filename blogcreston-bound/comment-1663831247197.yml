  DWI charges require complete total of the master methods commonly used in
  criminal cases.  protecting a DUI starts with making sure none of one's
  constitutional rights are trespassed. Because a police officer is in direct
  contact with you, while they are essentially the single witness all of the
  time, the training and MO is of the essence.  We all make accidents, and
  officers are no exception.  The Occasion happens when reasonable suspicion
  which will lead to probable cause. An example, you get forced over for driving
  too slow at 2 am.  The cop has the usual suspicion that you committed a
  traffic offense, racing.  then, when the law enforcment begins to make visual
  connection or moves in towards your car, law enforcement may remark you have
  red eyes, or there is an odor of beer. This raises the reasonable intuition of
  abnormal driving to providing the law enforcement a good idea that a person is
  operating while under the influence.  99.9% of officers will say odor of
  whiskey, watery ojos, or lazy talk.  They may usually say you were rumaging
  about getting your drivers license and insurance handy. At this point the
  driver will be likely told to step out of the vehicle and perform universal
  driving sobriety tests.  Those are SFSTâ€™s are learned under NHTSA (National
  Highway Traffic precautionary Administration) regulations and need to be
  assumed per instruction.  If you do perform the tests, the law enforcement
  official may make mistakes that can have the check, or tests disregarded from
  evidence.  Factors such as physical impairments and the best situational
  conditions should be integrated amoung the results of your field sobriety
  test. (i.e. you can not do a hop on one leg and pivot check on ramped
  pavement). A person will usually take a digital breath test.  There are
  accidents in these machines as well, after all they are devices that need to
  be maintained and training on regularly.  The incarceration is captured from
  the time the officer activates their lights.  It is through this captured
  footage we are able to inform an factual opinion on the law enforcement
  performing of the checks, to the clients performance taking the checks. If you
  consent to the tests or not, one will go to big house. If you know someone
  that has been incarcerated for Traffic Violations or any criminal charges or
  know some one who  needs a criminal defense Attorney take a look at my info
