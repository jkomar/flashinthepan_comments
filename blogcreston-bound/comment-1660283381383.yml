  DWI arrests require all of the specialized tools used in criminal trials. 
  protecting a OVI is initiated by understanding none of your constitutional
  rights are abused. Because a cop is in front of you, while they are basically
  the single witness all of the time, the directions and MO is of the essence. 
  some of us all make mis haps, and the law are no no exception to the rule. 
  The event begins with usual suspicion which can lead to probable cause. For
  example, a person gets flashed over for driving too slow at 2 AM.  The cop
  takes regular suspicion that you committed a traffic offense, racing.  then,
  as the police officer tries to make eye contact or moves in towards the auto,
  they will say you exhibit watery eyes, or there is an smell of alcohol. This
  raises the reasonable suspicion of recklessness to providing a cop a reason
  that someone may be operating while drunk.  80% of cops will say smell of
  whiskey, watery ojos, or mumbiling talk.  The police may usually say you are
  rumaging about getting your license and insurance card in your hand. Now a
  person will be likely asked to step out from the car and start universal
  physical sobriety checks.  These are SFST’s are taught under NHTSA (National
  road Traffic Safety Administration) regulations and need to be assumed per
  instruction.  If you do perform the checks, the cop will make mistakes that
  will make the check, or tests excluded from evidence.  Things such as physical
  disabilities and the best situational conditions should be integrated amoung
  the results of your performance. (example: you can’t perform a hop on one leg
  and pivot check on ramped pavement). A person may usually take a analkyzation
  of the breath tests.  There are defects in these gadgets also, after all they
  are devices that need to be maintained and trained on regularly.  The
  incarceration is videoed from the time the officer turns on their lights.  It
  is through this taped footage we are able to base an experienced opinion on
  the police giving of the checks, to the clients ability taking the checks.
  Whether you consent to the tests or not, a person usually will go to jail. If
  you have been arrested for Assualt or any criminal charges or know some one
