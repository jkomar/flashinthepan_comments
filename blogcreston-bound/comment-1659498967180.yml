  DWI allegations require all of the specialized tactics used in criminal court
  rooms.  Defending a OVI is initiated by understanding none of one's rights on
  the constitution were trespassed. When a cop is in direct contact with you,
  while they are essentially the single witness all of the time, the training
  and MO is of the nature.  some of us all make mistakes, and cops are no
  exception.  It starts when reasonable accusation which can progress to obvious
  cause. An example, you get pulled over for speeding at 4 am.  A police officer
  takes reasonable suspicion that aperson committed a traffic offense, passingon
  a double yellow.  Now, when the police tries to start visual contact or leans
  in closer to the vehicle, the cop will say you posess watery eyes, or there is
  an smell of beer. This elevates the acceptabel intuition of abnormal driving
  to giving the police probable cause that someone is crusing around while
  intoxicated.  ninety nine% of officers will say smell of whiskey, blood shot
  eye balls, or sloppy talk.  Law enforcement may also note you were rumaging
  about trying to get your id and insurance handy. At this point someone is
  likely asked to get out of the automobile and perform standardized field
  sobriety checks.  Those are SFSTâ€™s are taught under NHTSA (National Highway
  Traffic Safety Administration) standardizations and must be instructed per
  instruction.  If you do perform the tests, the cop can make mistakes which
  will have the check, or tests excluded from evidence.  Things such as physical
  impairments and optimal situational conditions can be integrated amoung the
  results of your performance. (example: you can not perform a hop and a skip
  and pivot test on ramped stret). Someone will also take a breathalyzer tests. 
  There are accidents in these machines as well, and they are machines that need
  to be maintained and training on every day.  The incarceration is captured at
  the time the law enforcement starts their lights.  It is through this taped
  evidence that we are able to inform an factual choice if the law enforcement
  administration of the checks, to the accused performance taking the tests.
  Whether you consent to the tests or not, someone usually will go to jail. If
  you have been arrested for OVI or any criminal charges or know some one who
